# Crypto exchange
Create a simple UI to show your crypto portfolio and history
1. First you should have a section, where to display all of your transaction history to buy/sell crypto assets. With name, amount, date
<br/>For example:  BTC - `+0.5` - 12/12/2012; BNB - `-100` - 13/12/2012 ; etc...
2. You can always add more to your history list
3. Integrate with any open api to exchange your asset to USD For example https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/exchange/reference or https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/ or any you can choose
4. Display the current of your total assets in USD
5. Current value should be realtime

Above are the minimum requirements
### Additional points
- Instead of USD, we can allow user to change to any other currency
- Allow to filter your total value by crypto asset (BTC or BNB or else... not only 1 each time, but multiple possible)
- Allow to filter by time (meaning total value between selected days) 
- Default/Current portfolio can be received from external api/file
- Value format-able
- Good structure / types
- Fancy UI
- Unit test
